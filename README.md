Customer satisfaction is paramount in the airline industry, as it directly impacts loyalty, repeat business, and overall reputation. Airlines strive to provide exceptional experiences through various touchpoints such as booking, check-in, onboard services, and post-flight interactions to ensure passengers feel valued and content, ultimately aiming to foster long-term relationships and positive word-of-mouth recommendations.

This dataset shows different factors effecting to airline passengers satisfations.Customer satisfaction is one of the most im The data set was quite clean so i did't need to spend time on cleaning.Instead of this I spent my time mainly on doing extensive EDA through putting different visualizations here.Some of my codes serves same answers with different solutions. 

## INTRODUCTION 

Airline passenger satisfaction is determined by a variety of factors that contribute to the overall travel experience. Key elements include punctuality, cleanliness, and comfort of the aircraft, as well as the quality of in-flight service and amenities provided. Efficient boarding and disembarking processes, along with helpful and courteous staff, can significantly enhance a passenger's journey. Additionally, transparent and flexible policies regarding luggage and cancellations are important.Technology, such as user-friendly booking and check-in processes, also plays a crucial role in boosting satisfaction. Overall, a seamless, stress-free, and enjoyable travel experience leads to higher passenger satisfaction.

## DATA

This data set is based on the satisfaction levels of an airline company.Data has 25 columns and 103904 rows with unique passenger ids.This project was assembled in a Python environment using Jupyter Notebook. The Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries were utilized for exploratory analysis.I made as many visualizations as possible.

## 🚨 PERSONAL NOTE : 📣 📢 📣 📢

### On this project i wanted show all skills those i can about EDA in python.That's why it is so long and some codes might seen unnecessary.I wanted to show the different perspectives for solutions.As known there isn't just one solution for some questions
